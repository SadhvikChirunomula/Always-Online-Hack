# Always-Online-Hack

This python programme will move you cursor to random location once in every 20 seconds. So, your machine will not get locked and also teams status will also be available.

## How to run

Make sure Python is installed in your machine.

1. First install the required packages. They are already available in the pip_packages.zip file. Unzip that file and you will have 8 .whl packages.. Install each package by running the command

    ```
    pip install MouseInfo-0.1.3-py3-none-any.whl
    pip install pytweening-1.0.4-py3-none-any.whl
    pip install pyperclip-1.8.2-py3-none-any.whl
    pip install PyGetWindow-0.0.9-py3-none-any.whl
    pip install python3_xlib-0.15-py3-none-any.whl
    pip install PyAutoGUI-0.9.53-py3-none-any.whl
    pip install PyMsgBox-1.0.9-py3-none-any.whl
    pip install PyRect-0.2.0-py2.py3-none-any.whl
    pip install PyScreeze-0.1.28-py3-none-any.whl
    ```
  
  There may be some issues while installing them. So, run the same list of commands two to three times.

2. Once all the packages are installed, Run the below command.. 

    ```
    python always_online.py
    ````
  
3. Once you run it, your cursor will move to random place once in every 20 seconds...
